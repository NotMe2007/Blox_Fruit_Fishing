# Blox Fruit Fishing Macro

Welcome to my macro! We call it a fishing macro, but it can be used for way more than just fishing. I'm working on making this a macro loader, meaning you can create combos and more using this tool.

## Features

- **Auto Bone Grinding**: Currently works with Elemental fruits. Make sure you stand at the position shown below â€” click the image to view full size.

- **Auto Fishing**: Working on a nice GUI and additional features.
- **Auto Webhook**: This will be useful for notifications and updates.

## Upcoming Features

- **PvP Aim Assist**: Please note that the aim assist will provide subtle assistance and will be barely noticeable. It only works when using Ken; otherwise, it does nothing.
- **Combo Loader**: Create your own combos. If you share them with me, I'll add them to the main script.
- **Up Trader**: This will check trade values on the <https://bloxfruitsvalues.com/values> and check what they put in baced on that it will and for fair trades It is a computer so it will do the math better than you and it wont trade for unfair and the uptrade will be atleast 5% min you can change this

If you have any ideas, feel free to drop them to me on Discord: [https://discord.gg/dHUM2ejQGY](https://discord.gg/dHUM2ejQGY)
